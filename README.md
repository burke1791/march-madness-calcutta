# What is Calcutta?

In this context, not the city in India. Rather, we are referring to a [Calcutta auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcutta_auction).

From Wikipedia: 
>A Calcutta auction is an open auction held in conjunction with a golf tournament, horse race or similar contest with multiple entrants. It is popular in backgammon, the Melbourne Cup, and college basketball pools during March Madness.

In the auction each contestant is sold to the highest bidder and pays out a portion of the prizepool based on how well they perform in the tournament. This site is primarily geared towards the yearly March Madness tournament, but occasionally I'll add other sports into the mix, e.g. MLB, NHL, NFL playoffs.

## Why doesn't the auction work?

Short answer: cost.

The back end infrastructure is hosted on AWS, and the service that powers the auction is not within their free tier. Currently, I only enable the auction services for the short windows of time when I or my friends are running auctions.

I am more than happy to enable it for you, just get in touch with me at <auctions@calcuttaleague.com> and I'll flip it on for a few hours when you need it.
